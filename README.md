# early-adventure-python
Only a simple project.

Just learning some ways for input and def functions and seeing if user input could be dynamically placed into a dictionary.


To run the game you have to run maingame.py. It takes the user input and inputs it into a dictionary that could be called later on, although this never came into fruition. The paths and choices are set, there is nothing past the red or blue room. 
The scope of an adventure game has somewhat exceeded what the code can do so this is only a very simple version of the game. 
I am currenty working on a newer version of another adventure game.
